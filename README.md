## Summary

The core proposal in this demo is the creation of a new A `RightHandRail` UI manager that is

1. Simplifying the grid

These are _not_ required to implement the `RightHandRail` component, but might be considered worthwhile: implementing them would be relatively light work

The following docs provide more context and detail:

- [Refactoring Article layout](docs/readme-layout.md)
- [Simplifying item placement in the Right Hand Rail](docs/readme-rhr.md)
